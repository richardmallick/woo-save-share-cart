### <a name="translation"></a> 5. Localization

You can translate the plugin in your language with the following steps. 

Consider you need to translate the plugin to Polish language (pl_PL)

1. Fork this repo, clone your forked repository in your system and create a new branch with `git checkout -b branch-name`

2. Go to `share-cart/languages` directory, create a new directory `pl_PL` (Same as locale).

3. Run `cp wcssc.pot pl_PL/wcssc-pl_PL.po`. This will create a .po inside `pl_PL` directory.

4. Open `wcssc-pl_PL.po` with poedit or any other software and translate the strings. Save the .mo file inside `languages/pl_PL` directory. .mo file name should be `wcssc-pl_PL.mo` (for this example).

5. Now, to translate JS string, you should run move to `share-cart` repository (Root of this repo). Run `npm install`. This will install jed and po2json for you.

6. Run command from root of the repo in terminal, `npx po2json languages/wcssc-js.po languages/pl_PL/wcssc-pl_PL-wcssc-main.json -p -f jed1.x`. Note that for other languages it should be in format `wcssc-{$locale}-wcssc-main.json`

7. Once the `.json` file is created, add the translation to that json file.

Once all the above steps are completed, commit and push the changes to your repository. Create a PR from your repo to this repo. For more information on how to create PR for someone else's repo, please refer [this link](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html)
